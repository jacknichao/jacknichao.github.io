A variety of supervised CPDP methods and some simple unsupervised CPDP methods have been proposed. In a recent study, Zhou et al. found that simple unsupervised CPDP methods (i.e., ManualDown and ManualUp) have a prediction performance comparable or even superior to complex supervised CPDP methods. Therefore, they suggested that the ManualDown should be treated as the baseline when considering non-effort-aware performance measures (NPMs) and the ManualUp should be treated as the baseline when considering effort-aware performance measures (EPMs) in future CPDP studies. However, in that work, these unsupervised methods are only compared with existing supervised CPDP methods using a small subset of NPMs, and the prediction results of baselines are directly collected from the primary literatures. Besides, the comparison has not considered other recently proposed EPMs, which consider context switches and developer fatigue due to initial false alarms. These limitations may not give a holistic comparison between the supervised methods and unsupervised methods. In this paper, we aim to revisit Zhou et al.’s study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a comparison between the existing supervised CPDP methods and the unsupervised methods proposed by Zhou et al. in the same experimental setting when considering both NPMs and EPMs. We also propose an improved supervised CPDP method EASC and make a further comparison with the unsupervised methods. According to the results on 82 projects in terms of 11 performance measures, we find that when considering NPMs, EASC can achieve prediction performance comparable or even superior to unsupervised method ManualDown in most cases. Besides, when considering EPMs, EASC can statistically significantly outperform the unsupervised method ManualUp with a large improvement in terms of Cliff’s delta in most cases. Therefore, the supervised CPDP methods are more promising than the unsupervised method in practical application scenarios, since the limitation of testing resource and the impact on developers cannot be ignored in these scenarios.

Most of the previous studies on CPDP tried to utilize the training data from other projects (i.e., the source projects) and then resorted to transfer learning to alleviate the data distribution difference between different projects. However, different metrics may be used by practitioners to measure the extracted program modules from different projects and performing CPDP across these projects with heterogeneous metrics is more challenging. This issue is named as heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP). Until now, researchers have proposed several novel HDP methods with promising performance. Recently, unsupervised methods have been widely studies in CPDP and show the competitive performance. Moreover, this kind of methods can be easily compared with HDP methods. To the best of our knowledge, whether HDP methods can perform significantly better than these unsupervised methods has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this article, we perform a replication study to have a holistic look in this issue. In particular, we compare stateof-the-art five HDP methods with state-of-the-art five unsupervised methods. Final results surprisingly show that these HDP methods do not perform significantly better than some of unsupervised methods (especially the simple unsupervised methods proposed by Zhou et al.) in terms of two non-effortaware performance measures (i.e., F1 and AUC ) and four effort-aware performance measures (i.e., ACC , Popt, PMI @20% and IFA). Then, we perform diversity analysis on defective modules via McNemar’s test and find the prediction diversity is more obvious when the comparison is performed between the HDP methods and the unsupervised methods than the comparisons only between the HDP methods or between the unsupervised methods. This shows the HDP methods and the unsupervised methods are complementary to each other in identifying defective modules to some extent. Finally, we investigate the feasibility of five HDP methods by considering two satisfactory criteria recommended by previous CPDP studies and find the satisfactory ratio of these HDP methods is still pessimistic. The above empirical results implicate there is still a long way for heterogeneous defect prediction to go. More effective HDP methods need to be designed and the unsupervised methods should be considered as baselines.","tags":["Software defect prediction","Cross-project defect prediction","Heterogeneous defect Prediction","Unsupervised method","Empirical studies"],"title":"Revisiting Heterogeneous Defect Prediction: How Far Are We?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Chen","Yanzhou Mu","Yubin Qu","Chao Ni","Meng Liu","Tong He","Shangqing Liu"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.   -- ","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"166ecf2a59f9317d75077fb4eb6e28a3","permalink":"https://jacknichao.github.io/publication/journal-article/2019-jsep-cpdp/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019-jsep-cpdp/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross‐project defect prediction (CPDP) is needed when the target projects are new projects or the projects have less training data, since these projects do not have sufficient historical data to build high‐quality prediction models. The researchers have proposed many CPDP methods, and previous studies have conducted extensive comparisons on the performance of different CPDP methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear whether different CPDP methods can identify the same defective modules, and this issue has not been thoroughly explored. In this article, we select 12 state‐of‐the‐art CPDP methods, including eight supervised methods and four unsupervised methods. We first compare the performance of these methods in the same experiment settings on five widely used datasets (ie, NASA, SOFTLAB, PROMISE, AEEEM, and ReLink) and rank these methods via the Scott‐Knott test. Final results confirm the competitiveness of unsupervised methods. Then we perform diversity analysis on defective modules for these methods by using the McNemar test. Empirical results verify that different CPDP methods may lead to difference in the modules predicted as defective, especially when the comparison is performed between the supervised methods and unsupervised methods. Finally, we also find there exist a certain number of defective modules, which cannot be correctly identified by any of the CPDP methods or can be correctly identified by only one CPDP method. These findings can be utilized to design more effective methods to further improve the performance of CPDP.

To effectively utilize the relatedness, we propose a novel approach MPR (multi- project regression) for SDNP (software defect number prediction).

However, in practice, we might only have limited labeled data from both the source and target projects in some scenarios. In this paper, we want to apply multitask learning to investigate such a new scenario. To our best knowledge, this problem (i.e., both the source project and the target project have limited labeled data) has not been thoroughly investigated, and we are the first to propose a novel multitask defect prediction approach MASK. MASK consists of a differential evolution optimization phase and amultitask learning phase. The former phase aims to find optimal weights for shared and nonshared information in related projects (i.e., the target project and its related source projects), while the latter phase builds prediction models for each project simultaneously. To verify the effectiveness of MASK, we perform experimental studies on 18 real-world software projects and compare our approach with four state-of-the-art baseline approaches: single-task learning (STL), simple combined learning (SCL), Peters filter, and Burak filter. Experimental results show that MASK can achieve F1 of 0.397 and AUC of 0.608 on average with a few labeled data (i.e., 10% of data). Across the 18 projects, MASK can outperform baseline methods significantly in terms of F1 and AUC. Therefore, by utilizing the relatedness among multiple projects, MASK can perform significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that MASK is promising for software defect prediction when the source and target projects both have limited training data.

Redundant features and irrelevant features may reduce the performance of the constructed models, which require feature selection methods to identify and remove them. Previous studies mostly treat feature selection as a single objective optimization problem, and multi-objective feature selection for SDP has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel method MOFES (MultiObjective FEature Selection), which takes two optimization objectives into account. One optimization objective is to minimize the number of selected features, tis objective is related to the cost analysis of this problem. Another objective is to maximize the performance of the constructed SDP models, this objective is related to the benefit analysis of this problem. MOFES utilizes Pareto based multi-objective optimization algorithms (PMAs) to solve this problem. In our empirical study, we design and conduct experiments on RELINK and PROMISE datasets, which are gathered from real open source projects. Firstly, we analyze the influence of different PMAs on MOFES and find that NSGA-II can achieve the best performance on both datasets. Then, we compare MOFES method with 22 state-of-the-art filter based and wrapper based feature selection methods, and find that MOFES can effectively select fewer but closely related features to construct high-quality models. Moreover, we also analyze the frequently selected features by MOFES, and these findings can be used to provide guidelines on gathering high-quality SDP datasets. Finally, we analyze the computational cost of MOFES and find that MOFES only needs 107 seconds on average.

However, this issue has not been investigated for SDNP. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a thorough comparison for these two different types of methods.\n\n**Method**: In our empirical studies, we consider 7 real open-source projects with 24 versions in total, use FPA and Kendall as our effort-aware performance measures, and consider three different performance evaluation scenarios (i.e., within-version scenario, cross-version scenario, and cross-project scenario).\n\n**Result**: We first identify two unsupervised methods with best performance. These two methods simply rank modules according to the value of metric LOC and metric RFC from large to small respectively. Then we compare 9 state-ofthe-art supervised methods incorporating SMOTEND, which is used for handling class imbalance problem, with the unsupervised method based on LOC metric (i.e., LOC D method). Final results show that LOC D method can perform significantly better than or the same as these supervised methods. Later motivated by a recent study conducted by Agrawla and Menzies, we apply differential evolutionary (DE) to optimize parameter value of SMOTEND used by these supervised methods and find that using DE can effectively improve the performance of these supervised methods for SDNP too. Finally, we continue to compare LOC D with these optimized supervised methods using DE, and LOC D method still has advantages in the performance, especially in the cross-version and cross-project scenarios.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on these results, we suggest that researchers need to use the unsupervised method LOC D as the baseline method, which is used for comparing their proposed novel methods for SDNP problem in the future.

In this paper, we propose a cluster-based novel method FeSCH (Feature Selection Using Clusters of Hybrid-Data) to alleviate the distribution differences by feature selection. FeSCH includes two phases. The feature clustering phase clusters features using a density-based clustering method, and the feature selection phase selects features from each cluster using a ranking strategy. For CPDP, we design three different heuristic ranking strategies in the second phase. To investigate the prediction performance of FeSCH, we design experiments based on real-world software projects, and study the effects of design options in FeSCH (such as ranking strategy, feature selection ratio, and classifiers). The experimental results prove the effectiveness of FeSCH. Firstly, compared with the  state-of-the-art baseline methods, FeSCH achieves better performance and its performance is less affected by the classifiers used. Secondly, FeSCH enhances the performance by effectively selecting features across feature categories, and provides guidelines for selecting useful features for defect prediction.","tags":["Cross Project Defect Prediction"],"title":"A Cluster Based Feature Selection Method for Cross-Project Software Defect Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Ni","Wangshu Liu","Qing Gu","Xiang Chen","Daoxu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.   -- ","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"d438fb167c2dd1c9494218afc073a6da","permalink":"https://jacknichao.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2017-compsac-fesch/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2017-compsac-fesch/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross project defect prediction (CPDP) is a challenging task since the predictor built on the source projects can hardly generalize well to the target project.

The experimental results show that FeSCH can outperform three baseline methods (i.e., WPDP, ALL, and TCA+) in most cases, and its performance is independent of the used classifiers.","tags":["Cross Project Defect Prediction"],"title":"FeSCH: A Feature Selection Method using Clusters of Hybrid-data for Cross-Project Defect Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://jacknichao.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
