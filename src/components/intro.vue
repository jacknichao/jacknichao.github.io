		To help developers and testers improving their productivity, my current research focuses on mining and analyzing
		rich data in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information. I have employed and customized
		structured and unstructured data analytics techniques, including data mining, information retrieval, natural
		language processing, search-based algorithms, and program analysis to transform passive software engineering data
		into automated tools and new insights.
